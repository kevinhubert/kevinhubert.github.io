Howdy,

My name is Kevin Hubert, and I'm a seasoned frontend web developer from Austin, Texas. I'm
interested in a position at your company and believe I would make significant contributions to
your team.

With over 12 years of experience, I offer senior-level web development skills and am an expert
in frontend technologies. While much of my experience is as a frontend developer, I've also
trained and advanced my back end development skills, making me a valuable and robust
technical asset.

Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable
code. My skills and personality lend themselves to excellent cross-team and inter-team
communication, whether working with marketing and product departments or leading meetings
with international teams.

My work experience includes ecommerce, mobile banking software, higher education, and
freelance projects. My analytical approach to problems, creative solutions, and technical growth
has contributed to the overall performance of past teams. Consider the following highlights from
my most recent position:

● Refactored legacy applications/sites to mobile first responsive designs using modern
frameworks such as Reactjs and Angular
● Authored over 100 reusable React components to be utilized in customer-facing
applications
● Led efforts to improve Core Web Vitals, resulting in 25% decreased load time across
multiple products

I look forward to the new opportunities and challenges of this role, and I'm eager to share my
skills and experience with a new team. Please feel free to contact me to schedule a time to talk.

Thanks,
Kevin
